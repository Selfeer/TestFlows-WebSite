is being actively developed and improved.

# Background

The motivation for the framework came from the experience of developing test automation for various projects. 
After developing multiple custom closed-source test automation systems,
and not being quite satisfied with the capabilities and the approach
of other open-source projects, TestFlows serves as a platform for providing 
a flexible framework that can easily be adapted to the testing task at hand.

# Goals

The goal of the project is to provide an enterprise quality test framework 
to avoid writing more closed-source automation
systems. A generic tool that can be used across multiple
personal, open-source and commercial projects that require different
level of formalism.
