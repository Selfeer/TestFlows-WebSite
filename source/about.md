has been actively developed and improved.

# Background

{% html div class="text-center" %}
The motivation for the framework came from the experience of developing test automation for various projects.
After developing multiple custom closed-source test automation systems
and not being quite satisfied with the capabilities and the approach
of other open-source projects, {% testflows %} serves as a platform for providing
a flexible framework that can easily be adapted to the testing task at hand.

# Goals

{% html div class="text-center" %}
The goal of the project is to provide an enterprise-quality testing framework
to avoid writing more closed-source automation
systems. A generic tool that can be used across multiple
personal, open-source, and commercial projects that require different
levels of formality.
