How does software development process such as behavior driver development (BDD), test driven development (TDD),
or even acceptance test driven development (ATDD) affect quality assurance? To answer this question
we need to first note that all these terms end with "development" and not with "quality assurance".
But could we define behavior driven quality assurance (BDQA), test driven quality assurance (TDQA),
or even acceptance test driven quality assurance (ATDQA). If so, what would be the difference between them?
Well, it would depend on the definitions of a behavior, a test, and an acceptance test.<!-- more -->

A few days ago, I came cross a thread on Reddit titled [How is BDD used in your team?](https://www.reddit.com/r/QualityAssurance/comments/16pis7x/how_is_bdd_used_in_your_team/?utm_campaign=Software%2BTesting%2BWeekly&utm_medium=web&utm_source=Software_Testing_Weekly_188) that mentioned BDD, TDD, and ATDD in the discussion.
While quite a few people had negative comments regarding the BDD approach, I asked myself a single
question. How can developers and testers make better decisions and could there be less controversy
around these different software development processes and how a quality assurance team
participates in them?

Unfortunately, I concluded that most developers and testers lack the precise definitions of the key concepts
that are related to software development and quality assurance. People pick just trendy tools or processes instead
of basing their decisions on the fundamental understanding of the underlying concepts.

The fundamental understanding of the underlying concepts lies in precise definition of the following terms:

* software system
* quality
* behavior
* test

If you have read our recent blog on [Working With Requirements Just Like With Code](https://testflows.com/blog/working-with-requirements-just-like-with-code/) you already have the answers but for those who did not
let's quickly define these terms precisely and then see if we can talk about BDD, TDD, and ATDD
in more constructive manner.

#### Software system?

A good definition can taken from Norman Papernick at Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science.

{% blockquote Norman Papernick https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15671-f95/www/handouts/sm-basics/node1.html , Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science  %}
"A software system is a very, very complicated state machine."
{% endblockquote %}

#### What is quality?

Here is the definition that I prefer.

> â€œQuality is satisfying requirements and
> requirement is a description of a behavior.

#### What is behavior?

A behavior can be precisely defined by using Leslie Laport's definition from his
[TLA+, Specifying Systems](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/book.html?back-link=learning.html#book).

{% blockquote Leslie Lamport, TLA+ - https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/book.html?back-link=learning.html#book Specifying Systems %}
"Behavior is an infinite sequence of states."<br>
"State is an assignment of values to variables."
{% endblockquote %}

#### What is a test?

> Test is a sequence of steps that attempts to verify one or more behaviors.

It should be noted that a sequence of steps in a test is usually referred to as a test procedure.

# What is the difference between BDD, TDD and ATDD?

The answer is that if you use the definitions above they are actually pretty much talking about tightly related things.
Why? Because a test is a sequence of steps that verifies a behavior, therefore BDD and TDD are related.
However, the definition of a test depends on the behavior and therefore a test exist only
because there is some behavior that needs to be verified. Therefore,
by definition BDD is actually using a higher concept then TDD. Again, because a behavior exists above a test.
The other way to think about it, is that a behavior does not really need a test but a test needs
a behavior.

> Test exist only because there is some behavior that needs to be verified.

What about ATDD? What does "acceptance" mean? It refers to acceptance criterias that need to be tested.
What is an acceptance criteria? Whatever definition you've seen, you should convince yourself that
an acceptance criteria is nothing but a requirement which is description of behavior.
Therefore, an acceptance criteria is just a behavior.

Putting this together we have that BDD and ATDD are at the same conceptual level and TDD is using a lower
level concept but is related to BDD.

# How does it affect your QA team?

Irrespective of software development process, quality assurance team must ensure product quality.
Therefore, it really depends on how your QA team defines quality.

For me, quality is satisfying requirements, where requirement is a description
of a behavior. Thus, irrespective of the BDD, TDD, or ATDD, quality assurance team needs descriptions of product behaviors,
also know as requirements, in order to verify if product meets them, has quality, or not, does not have quality.
Where and how these requirements are defined is secondary as the most important part is they are actually defined
and written down!

It all makes sense if you use clear definitions and a have the fundamental understanding of the underlying concepts.
Software system, quality, behavior and test. Define them precisely and you will discover the beauty and challenges
that developers and tester face everyday implementing and testing real-world software systems.

# So should your team use BDD?

Yes, and no. BDD gets many things right starting with putting the concept of a behavior right up front of the development process
as it should be. If development team uses BDD then QA team inherits at least some form of formalization of the product behavior.
This is definitely better then not having product behavior clearly defined. It also supports explicit and clear test procedures. However, one need to decouple BDD as a concept from its implementations that are tied to Gherkin, but this is a topic for another
article.
