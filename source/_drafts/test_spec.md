The ad-hoc approach to writing tests is the most common authoring technique. 
Writing separate test specifications is not realistic for most projects and are often
hard to maintain. Sooner or later, test specification and the code diverge as
each exists in a different domain. However, writing test specifications and documenting 
test code does not have to be an explicit task in itself. 
At least with {% testflows %}, it isn't.
